# Carpets and furniture

**Be careful when you handle furnitures**

* Carpets must be dried within the first two days. Carpets soaked with sewage must be discarded immediately.
* Remove residual mud and soil from furniture, appliances, etc.
* If items are just damp, let the mud dry and then brush it off.
* To test if material is dry, tape clear food wrap to the surface of the item. If the covered section turns darker than the surrounding material, it is still damp. Dry until this no longer occurs.
* For upholstered furniture you should consult a professional to see what can be salvaged. In the meantime, remove cushions and dry separately. Do not remove upholstery. Raise furniture on blocks and place fans underneath.
* Wooden furniture: Remove drawers and open doors. Do not dry quickly or splitting may occur.
