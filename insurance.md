## Standard Claims Process

The claims process looks something like this:

* First an intimation of claim by letter or mail will need to be given

  immediately based on which a surveyor will be appointed for assessing

  the loss.

* The surveyor need to be provided with all documents like stock register,

  purchases and sales register, balance sheet, etc.

* The surveyor He will also see if the all items are insured and for the correct

  value.

* Accordingly loss assessment will be done.
* If the amount insured is less than the actual value claim will be

  proportionately reduced.

* On receipt of survey report, claim will be settled.

## Expediate the claims process

### Things You Can Do

* If you have multiple kinds of insurance for different items \(vehicle

  insurance for vehicles, property insurance for household and posessions, etc\)

  it is recommended that you categorize what item is applicable to which policy

  and then make a list of items that need to be claimed.

* If your vehicle got submerged in water, take photos of it before towing it to

  a workshop.

* Take as many photos of your house as you can, so that you can cover different

  items that have been damaged.

* You can use photos of items inside your house before the flood as proof while

  accounting for what has been lost.

* If you have made any purchases online or otherwise have receipts that haven't

  been washed away, these also help expediate the claims process.
