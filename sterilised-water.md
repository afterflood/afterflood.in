# Sterilised water

Most flooded areas are cut off from bottled/ safe water supplies. Here's what you can do to sterilise ANY water.

**Fill up your cooker with water. Pressure cook for 10 to 15 whistles \(15 mins\) at high heat. Filter and use. You can add a few spoons of cumin if you like.**

ANY water becomes safe to drink if sterilised this way.
